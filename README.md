The options should be intelligently selected based on previous choices. For example, if the person chose a veggie meal, meat options should not be offered. If a person chose healthy meal, fatty sauces should not be offered. If a person chose vegan meal, cheese top-up should not be offered. If a person chose value meal, no top-up should be offered.

## Additional information
For MacOS, homebrew's latest swi-prolog version is unstable. Hence it has to backtrack into using the following version instead.

`$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/09a94009142a6265b0b8e322463100610aeda964/Formula/swi-prolog.rb`
